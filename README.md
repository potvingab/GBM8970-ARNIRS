Conception d'un système combiné réalité augmentée et imagerie cérébrale NIRS
Design of a combined virtual reality and NIRS brain imaging system

## What is GBM8970-VRNIRS?
This is a University project developed by Polytechnique Montréal students in collaboration with [PERFORM Centre of Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/research/perform.html). It includes two psychological paradigms: Stroop and N-Back. Both are visualized with the Meta 2 AR headset. Stroop is a color-word interference test and only requires the headset. In Stroop, a word is displayed on the participant's screen, as well as 3 buttons allowing the participant to answer the questions. The buttons are presented as 3 cubes with the words GREEN, BLUE and RED that the participant must grab for the question to be answered. N-back is a memory test that asks the patient if the current stimulus is the same as the one from n-steps earlier in the sequence. In our case the stimulus is an audio and/or a visual image. The participant is provided with two press buttons to indicate if the stimuli are the same or different.
